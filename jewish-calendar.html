    <h1>Understanding the Jewish Calendar</h1>

    <p>The Jewish calendar is a lunisolar calendar that plays a central role in Jewish life, dictating the dates of holidays, festivals, and significant events. It is based on both the cycles of the moon and the sun, creating a unique and precise structure.</p>

    <h2>1. Lunar Months and Solar Years</h2>
    <p>The Jewish calendar is primarily based on lunar months, each consisting of either 29 or 30 days. Twelve lunar months total approximately 354 days, making the lunar year shorter than the solar year by about 11 days.</p>
    <p>The exact length of a lunar month is 29 days, 12 hours, and an additional 793/1080 of an hour. Thus, the exact length of the lunar year is 354 days, 8 hours, and an additional 73/90 of an hour.</p>

    <h2>2. Leap Years</h2>
    <p>To realign the lunar and solar cycles, a leap year is added seven times every 19 years. During a leap year, a second month of Adar, called <em>Adar II</em>, is added to the calendar, ensuring that holidays remain in their designated seasons.</p>

    <h2>3. Months of the Jewish Calendar</h2>
    <p>The Jewish calendar includes the following months:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Tishrei (30 days)</li>
      <li>Cheshvan (29 or 30 days)</li>
      <li>Kislev (29 or 30 days)</li>
      <li>Tevet (29 days)</li>
      <li>Shevat (30 days)</li>
      <li>Adar (29 days, 30 days in leap years)</li>
    	  <li>Adar II (leap years only, 29 days)</li>
      <li>Nisan (30 days)</li>
      <li>Iyar (29 days)</li>
      <li>Sivan (30 days)</li>
      <li>Tammuz (29 days)</li>
      <li>Av (30 days)</li>
      <li>Elul (29 days)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Rosh Chodesh</h2>
    <p>The beginning of each new month, known as <em>Rosh Chodesh</em>, is marked by the appearance of the new moon. It is a semi-festive day, with special prayers and traditions observed.</p>

    <h2>5. Calculating the Jewish Date</h2>
    <p>Jewish dates are calculated from Creation, which is considered to have occurred in 3761 BCE. Thus, the Jewish year 5785 corresponds to 2024-2025 CE.</p>

    <h2>6. Holiday Observances</h2>
    <p>The Jewish calendar determines the dates of all holidays, including Passover in Nisan, Yom Kippur in Tishrei, and Purim in Adar. Each holiday is observed on specific days and includes unique mitzvot and customs.</p>

    <h2>7. Significance of the Moon</h2>
    <p>The moon’s cycle symbolizes the Jewish people's journey, with its waxing and waning representing times of spiritual growth and challenge. According to Chassidus, the moon is on the level of Malchus. Malchus has nothing of its own, and that is reflected in the moon receiving light from the sun. The sanctification of the new moon, or <em>Kiddush Levana</em>, is a reminder of G-d’s presence and the renewal of the Jewish nation.</p>

    <p>The Jewish calendar is more than just a system of days and months; it is a spiritual framework that connects the Jewish people to their history, traditions, and purpose.</p>
