    <h1>The Mitzvot of Yom Kippur</h1>

    <p>Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, is the holiest day of the Jewish year. It is a day of intense reflection, repentance, and prayer. Several mitzvot (commandments) are observed to honor the solemnity and sanctity of this day:</p>

    <h2>1. Fasting</h2>
    <p>The primary mitzvah of Yom Kippur is to fast for 25 hours, abstaining from food and drink. This fast is a powerful act of self-denial, focusing on spiritual rather than physical needs.</p>

    <h2>2. Refraining from Physical Comforts</h2>
    <p>In addition to fasting, five forms of physical pleasure are prohibited on Yom Kippur: eating and drinking, washing, applying lotions or oils, wearing leather shoes, and marital relations.</p>

    <h2>3. Prayer and Confession</h2>
    <p>Yom Kippur is characterized by extended synagogue services, including the recitation of the <em>Vidui</em> (confession) and the powerful <em>Neilah</em> prayer, which closes the day.</p>

    <h2>4. Repentance and Forgiveness</h2>
    <p>Before Yom Kippur begins, it is customary to seek forgiveness from others, acknowledging wrongdoings and asking for pardon. This act of reconciliation is a crucial part of the day’s observance, because G-d only forgives wrongdoings <em>bein adam l'Makom</em>, between people and G-d.</p>

    <h2>5. Wearing White</h2>
    <p>Many wear white clothing on Yom Kippur to symbolize purity and spiritual elevation. It is a reminder of the angelic state one aspires to achieve through repentance, as well as a reminder of the day of death.</p>

    <h2>6. The Closing Shofar Blast</h2>
    <p>The fast concludes with a single, long blast of the <em>shofar</em>, symbolizing the closing of the heavenly gates and sealing of the year’s judgment.</p>

    <p>Through these mitzvot, Yom Kippur becomes a day of intense spiritual work, cleansing, and renewal, allowing each person to start the new year with a pure heart and a clear conscience.</p>
