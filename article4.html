	<h2>The 39 Melachot, Forbidden Labors on Shabbat</h2>
    <p>In this article, we will discuss the 39 forbidden labors of Shabbat. We will also discuss common subcategories of these labors.</p>
    <p>1. Zorei'a/Planting</p>
    <p>Planting, the av melachah of zorei'a, is forbidden on Shabbat, and includes any activity that promotes vegetative growth. One transgresses the melachah even if the planting produces no results; dropping a seed or pit on soil, for example. Since the seed could germinate and produce a tree or a plant, dropping the seed is considered an act of planting (Shulchan Aruch HaRav 336:10). It is important to note that we follow the halachic guidelines even when they seem obscure. For example, one may not place a potted plant onto grass on Shabbat, since the plant can now draw nutrients from the ground, improving its growth. Moreover, the plant is muktzeh, meaning it cannot be moved at all over Shabbat.</p>
    <p>All primary categories of work (avos melachos, sing. av melacha) are derived from labors done in the Mishkan (Tabernacle).</p>
    <p>Various herbs were planted to create the dyes used in the Mishkan (Rashi on Shabbat 73a). Additionally, wheat was planted to produce flour for some of the sacrifices and for the lechem hapanim, the showbread, which was baked and used in the Mishkan on a weekly basis. This is the opinion of Rabbi Hai Gaon.</p>
    <p>Toladot, subcategories, of zorei'a include watering grass (Shulchan Aruch HaRav 252:16), pruning trees, weeding to improve growth of existing plants, and fumigating plants with pesticides.</p>
    <p>Common activities to avoid include turning on a sprinkler system, moving a plant to a place where it will get more sun, dropping a pit or fruit seed on soil, and having a water fight on dirt or grass.</p>
