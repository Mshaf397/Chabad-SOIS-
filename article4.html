                In this article, we will discuss the 39 forbidden labors of Shabbat. We will also discuss common subcategories of these labors.
            </p>

            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                All primary categories of work (<strong class="text-indigo-700">avos melachos</strong>, sing. av melacha) are derived from labors done in the Mishkan (Tabernacle).

            <!-- 1. Zorei'a/Planting -->
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-orange-600 border-b mt-8 pb-1">1. Zorei'a / Planting</h3>
            <p>Planting, the av melachah of <strong class="text-indigo-700">zorei'a</strong>, is forbidden on Shabbat, and includes any activity that promotes vegetative growth. One transgresses the melachah even if the planting produces no results; dropping a seed or pit on soil, for example. Since the seed could germinate and produce a tree or a plant, dropping the seed is considered an act of planting (Shulchan Aruch HaRav 336:10). It is important to note that we follow the halachic guidelines even when they seem obscure. For example, one may not place a potted plant onto grass on Shabbat, since the plant can now draw nutrients from the ground, improving its growth. Moreover, the plant is muktzeh, meaning it cannot be moved at all over Shabbat.</p>
            <p class="text-indigo-700 font-semibold mt-4">Source of the Labor:</p>
            <p>Various herbs were planted to create the dyes used in the Mishkan (Rashi on Shabbat 73a). Additionally, wheat was planted to produce flour for some of the sacrifices and for the lechem hapanim, the showbread, which was baked and used in the Mishkan on a weekly basis. This is the opinion of Rabbi Hai Gaon.</p>
            <p class="text-indigo-700 font-semibold mt-4">Toladot (Subcategories) of Zorei'a include:</p>

            <!-- 2. Choresh/Plowing -->
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-orange-600 border-b mt-8 pb-1">2. Choresh / Plowing</h3>
            <p>Plowing, the av melachah of <strong class="text-indigo-700">choresh</strong>, is forbidden on Shabbat. When one plows, the plowshare cuts into the hard soil, loosening it, making it fertile ground in which to plant. Any other action which accomplishes this is included in the melachah of choresh. There is no minimum amount of soil required, since one can plant a seed even in a small area of earth that has been properly conditioned (Eglai Tal, Choresh 2). There is also no specific method in which the melachah must be done. Even scraping the ground with one’s shoe or a heavy chair—if it loosens the earth—is considered choresh.</p>
            <p class="text-indigo-700 font-semibold mt-4">Source of the Labor:</p>
            <p>Plowing was part of the process to grow the herbs used to produce certain dyes for the Mishkan (Rashi on Shabbat 73a). Others source the melachah to the plowing used to produce wheat for some of the sacrifices and for the lechem hapanim, the showbread, which was baked on a weekly basis. This is the opinion of Rabbi Hai Gaon.</p>
            <p class="text-indigo-700 font-semibold mt-4">Toladot (Subcategories) of Choresh include:</p>

            <!-- 3. Kotzeir/Reaping -->
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-orange-600 border-b mt-8 pb-1">3. Kotzeir / Reaping</h3>
            <p>Reaping, the av melachah of <strong class="text-indigo-700">kotzeir</strong>, is forbidden on Shabbat and includes any activity which uses a tool to detach a plant, branch, or fruit from its source of growth. Inhibiting or preventing growth is not included. For example, neither taking flowers out of a vase nor shutting off a sprinkler system is included in kotzeir, even though both actions prevent further vegetative growth. Simply put, kotzeir has nothing to do with stopping something from growing; it is the simple act of severing a plant from its source of growth (Shulchan Aruch HaRav 336:19). The Jerusalem Talmud (Shabbat 48b, ch. 7 Halacha 2) understands that kotzeir can be applied to humans and animals as well. Halacha does not accept this definition in its final analysis, and although shearing wool and cutting nails are forbidden on Shabbat, they fall into the category of gozez (shearing), rather than kotzeir.</p>
            <p class="text-indigo-700 font-semibold mt-4">Source of the Labor:</p>
            <p>Kotzair was done when they picked the herbs to make dyes for the Mishkan (Rashi on Shabbat 73a) and cut wheat to produce flour for some of the sacrifices and for the lechem hapanim, the showbread, which was baked in the Mishkan on a weekly basis. This is the opinion of Rabbi Hai Gaon.</p>
            <p class="text-indigo-700 font-semibold mt-4">Toladot (Subcategories) of Kotzeir include:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 text-gray-700 bg-indigo-50 p-3 rounded-lg">
                <li>Lifting a perforated flower pot from the ground (because the plant in the pot is drawing sustenance from the ground) (Eglai Tal Kotzer 7)</li>
                <li>Shaking a tree to cause the fruit to fall (ibid.) (because this is not the normal way of picking fruit, it only resembles the av melacha)</li>
                <li>Picking a fruit or vegetable with one's hand (if it is normally picked with a tool) (Eglai Tal Kotzer 5).</li>

            <!-- 4. Me'ameir/Gathering -->
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-orange-600 border-b mt-8 pb-1">4. Me'ameir / Gathering</h3>
            <p>Gathering produce, the av melachah of <strong class="text-indigo-700">me’ameir</strong>, is forbidden on Shabbat (Eglai Tal, Me'amer 1, Shulchan Aruch Harav 340:15). In the Mishkan, me’ameir involved gathering produce in the field after it was cut. One only transgresses the biblical prohibition if he gathers produce which grew from the ground (<strong class="text-indigo-700">Gidulei Karka</strong>) and is gathered at the location of growing (<strong class="text-indigo-700">Makom Gidulo</strong>).</p>
            <p class="text-indigo-700 font-semibold mt-4">Source of the Labor:</p>
            <p>The herbs and plants used in the dyes needed for the Mishkan were gathered after being cut (Rashi, Shabbat 73a). Additionally, the wheat for the flour used in some of the sacrifices and for the lechem hapanim, the showbread, was gathered after being harvested. This is the opinion of Rav Hai Gaon.</p>
            <p class="text-indigo-700 font-semibold mt-4">Toladot (Subcategories) of Me'ameir include:</p>

                <li>Making a fruit kebab with whole, uncut fruit.</li>

            <!-- 5. Dosh/Threshing -->
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-orange-600 border-b mt-8 pb-1">5. Dosh / Threshing</h3>
            <p>Threshing, the av melachah of <strong class="text-indigo-700">dosh</strong>, is forbidden on Shabbat. Essentially, dosh is the removal of foods or liquids from where they are encased. The threshing in the Mishkan was done while the produce was still in the field. Most of our fruits and vegetables are peeled just before they are eaten, and the peels are considered part of the fruit, so peeling them is permitted. However, one should be careful not to use a peeler on Shabbat, and use a knife instead.</p>
            <p class="text-indigo-700 font-semibold mt-4">Source of the Labor:</p>
            <p>Flour was needed for the lechem hapanim—the showbread which was baked on a weekly basis—and for some of the sacrifices. To produce the flour, the wheat needed to be threshed after it was harvested. Plants were also threshed to make dyes for parts of the Mishkan.</p>
            <p class="text-indigo-700 font-semibold mt-4">Mefarek, a common toladah of dosh (Mishneh Torah 21:12), includes:</p>
