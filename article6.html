    <h1>The Mitzvot of Rosh Hashanah</h1>

    <p>Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, is a day of judgment, remembrance, and renewal. Several important mitzvot (commandments) are traditionally observed to mark this sacred day:</p>

    <h2>1. Hearing the Shofar</h2>
    <p>One of the most central mitzvot of Rosh Hashanah is to hear the blowing of the <em>shofar</em> (ram's horn). The shofarâ€™s sound serves as a spiritual wake-up call, encouraging introspection and repentance.</p>

    <h2>2. Tashlich Ceremony</h2>
    <p>Many perform the <em>Tashlich</em> ritual on the afternoon of the first day of Rosh Hashanah (or the second day if the first day is Shabbat), symbolically casting away sins by throwing bread crumbs into flowing water that has fish.</p>

    <h2>3. Festive Meals</h2>
    <p>It is customary to eat special festive meals that include symbolic foods like apples dipped in honey, representing the hope for a sweet new year.</p>

    <h2>4. Prayer and Repentance</h2>
    <p>Extended synagogue prayers include special additions like the <em>Unetaneh Tokef</em>, emphasizing the themes of judgment and mercy.</p>

    <h2>5. Sanctification of the Day</h2>
    <p>Rosh Hashanah is one of the biblically mandated holidays, and its sanctification through prayers and rituals is a fundamental mitzvah.</p>

    <p>These mitzvot together help create a meaningful and spiritually powerful observance of Rosh Hashanah.</p>
