    <h1>The Mitzvot of Sukkot</h1>

    <p>Sukkot, also known as the Festival of Booths, is a joyous holiday that commemorates the protection G-d provided the Jewish people in the wilderness. It is marked by several key mitzvot:</p>

    <h2>1. Dwelling in the Sukkah</h2>
    <p>The primary mitzvah of Sukkot is to dwell in a <em>sukkah</em>, a temporary hut covered with natural materials. For seven days, we eat, learn, and even sleep in the sukkah to remember G-d’s protection in the desert. Note that Chabad custom is to not sleep in the sukkah, although most Jews do.</p>

    <h2>2. Taking the Four Species</h2>
    <p>We are commanded to take the Four Species – the <em>lulav</em> (palm branch), <em>etrog</em> (citron), <em>hadas</em> (myrtle), and <em>aravah</em> (willow) – and shake them in six directions to acknowledge G-d’s presence everywhere.</p>

    <h2>3. Rejoicing in the Festival</h2>
    <p>Sukkot is a time of joy, referred to in the Torah as <em>Zman Simchateinu</em>, the “Time of Our Rejoicing.” The mitzvah is to celebrate by eating festive meals, singing, and being happy throughout the holiday.</p>

    <h2>4. The Ushpizin – Spiritual Guests</h2>
    <p>Each night of Sukkot, we welcome seven spiritual guests – Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Aaron, Joseph, and David – into the sukkah to inspire us and remind us of their virtues.</p>

    <h2>5. Hoshana Rabbah</h2>
    <p>The seventh day of Sukkot, known as <em>Hoshana Rabbah</em>, is a day of special prayers and rituals, including the beating of willow branches, symbolizing the culmination of the season’s judgment.</p>

    <p>Sukkot is a time to embrace both the physical and spiritual, bringing together the temporary and the eternal through the mitzvot of the holiday.</p>
